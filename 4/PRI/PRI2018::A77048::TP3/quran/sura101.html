      <h4>101. The Terrible Calamity</h4>
      <p>The terrible calamity!</p>
      <p>What is the terrible calamity!</p>
      <p>And what will make you comprehend what the terrible calamity is?</p>
      <p>The day on which men shall be as scattered moths,</p>
      <p>And the mountains shall be as loosened wool.</p>
      <p>Then as for him whose measure of good deeds is heavy,</p>
      <p>He shall live a pleasant life.</p>
      <p>And as for him whose measure of good deeds is light,</p>
      <p>His abode shall be the abyss.</p>
      <p>And what will make you know what it is?</p>
      <p>A burning fire.</p>
      <p></p>
