      <h4>94. The Expansion</h4>
      <p>Have We not expanded for you your breast,</p>
      <p>And taken off from you your burden,</p>
      <p>Which pressed heavily upon your back,</p>
      <p>And exalted for you your esteem?</p>
      <p>Surely with difficulty is ease.</p>
      <p>With difficulty is surely ease.</p>
      <p>So when you are free, nominate.</p>
      <p>And make your Lord your exclusive object.</p>
      <p></p>
